What's done can't be undone.

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,100
Now, I just want to figure out
the truth of the devils' revolt

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,880
to propitiate the dead of Daze Mountain.

32
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,460
Time to vindicate Yin, too.

33
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,350
Didn't His Godship

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,740
ask Her Majesty Feng Yuan to persuade
the Phoenix Queen?

35
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,300
How could it have no effect?

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,060
Feng Yuan sent a reply.

37
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,580
She said that the Phoenix Queen
is truly persistent.

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,780
She is determined to uncover
the truth of the past.

39
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,550
Didn't His Godship ask me
to break off the engagement?

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,710
Why did he suddenly care about
the Phoenix Queen so much?

41
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,620
What is exactly going on here?

42
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,140
Your Majesty.

43
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,020
Elder Feng Yun.

44
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,340
Her Ladyship will meet the Wind Lord
today and you're invited, too.

45
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,880
(Hong Yi, I've invited Wind Lord
to Fengyi Palace for verification)

46
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,740
(of the truth about Yin's entanglement with
devils a thousand years ago. Feng Yin)

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,550
I have to go to Wutong Island now.

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,310
Go to the Pear Blossom Cottage and
tell Yan Shuang that I will arrive later.

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,400
Yes.

50
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,340
(Beautiful Spring After the Snow)

51
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,270
Hong Yi.

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,350
Her Ladyship is so charming.

53
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,840
One is the God of Qingchi Palace.

54
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,430
The other is the Demon King
of Xuanjing Palace.

55
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,700
They are not only prestigious,
but also handsome.

56
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,870
Whom do you think Her Ladyship
will ultimately choose?

57
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,150
It must be the Demon King.

58
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,180
He was personally invited by
Her Ladyship by writing a letter.

59
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,620
I think Her Ladyship won't make a choice.

60
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,620
She will get both of them.

61
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,750
Yes.

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,460
- Your Godship.
- Don't.

63
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,360
Well…

64
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,440
Your Godship, don't get in.

65
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,030
Elder Feng Yun,

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,390
why didn't you stop that guy just now?

67
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,270
Her Majesty said they would investigate
the case about Demon King Lin Sen.

68
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,870
Irreverent persons shall not enter
without invitation.

69
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,660
His Godship has been investigating
this matter for a thousand years.

70
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,190
How could he be an irreverent person?

71
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,020
Her Ladyship specifically instructed that
only the Demon King can enter the palace.

72
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,220
This is the clue that
God Yuan Qi found at that time.

73
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,460
(Confidential)

74
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,440
Although there are some
useful information,

75
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,580
it couldn't prove Yin's innocence.

76
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,200
(The old scar on the right arm of the Wind Lord
can prove what he said is true)

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,100
Wind Lord, did you suffer any injuries
back then?

78
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,270
Hong Yi had a battle with me when
escaping from Immortal-locking Tower.

79
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,020
This scar was left at that time.

80
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,830
Yin, let's go.

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,220
This is indeed the scar left by
my Fire Palm.

82
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,340
It will take several days to
recover the spiritual power.

83
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,910
Even if the sword was not stolen,

84
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,230
you cannot possibly have the power to
kill the Demon King after injury.

85
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,390
I thought of this when Yuan Qi
and I analyzed it.

86
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,080
I didn't want the conflict to escalate due to
the incident of Hong Yi hurting me.

87
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,940
(When His Majesty Lin Sen was assassinated,)
So my injury was not announced.

88
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,510
(the surrounding guards
all show signs of amnesia)

89
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,980
At that time, the Immortal Realm
had already set up the super barrier.

90
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,310
If there were no assistance
from the immortals,

91
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,220
how could Qing Lin easily get close to
His Majesty Lan Feng

92
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,780
without causing any disturbance?

93
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,900
Could it be Feng Ming?

94
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,070
With Feng Ming's immortal power,

95
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,510
it would be impossible for him to do this.

96
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,660
There must be a mole more
powerful than him in the Immortal Realm.

97
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,900
God Yuan Qi has informed me that
he will find evidence soon.

98
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,190
I believe the day when the truth
is revealed is not far away.

99
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,100
Did His Godship find out anything?

100
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,750
He hasn't communicated the details
with me yet,

101
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,070
but he said he has his own arrangements.

102
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,710
Since both you and His Godship
are investigating this matter,

103
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,340
I think it's better to work together
and pool our efforts.

104
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,800
If you don't mind, let me...

105
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,320
Thank you, Wind Lord. Don't bother.

106
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,580
I have always been doing things alone.

107
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,870
I don't like to cooperate with others.

108
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,190
However, I will reinvestigate this
thousand-year-old case in a few days.

109
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,100
I hope Your Lordship lends
a helping hand at that time.

110
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,710
This is my duty.

111
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,630
By the way, Hong Yi,
you go find Yan Shuang.

112
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,580
When the time is ripe, I will need her
to come to the Heavenly Palace.

113
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,320
Okay.

114
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,080
Oh my.

115
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,090
I forgot I had an appointment
with Yan Shuang today.

116
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,960
Today?

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,100
Why don't you go now?

118
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,180
(Beautiful Spring After the Snow)

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,710
(Could it be that Jiu forgot about this?)

120
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,390
(Forget it. I'll go find him myself.)

121
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,640
Hong Yun.

122
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,590
Your Highness,
you don't have to wait anymore.

123
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,950
His Majesty
has something important to do.

124
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,870
He asked me to tell you.

125
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,940
Where did he go?

126
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,310
His Majesty went to Wutong Island
to find the Phoenix Queen.

127
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,630
When did he go?

128
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,710
In the early morning when he received
Phoenix Queen's letter.

129
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,510
Did he say when he will come back?

130
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
No.

131
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,270
I don't think he can come back tonight.

132
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,980
Don't wait for him here anymore.

133
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,630
The Pear Blossom Cottage
is right in the Mortal Realm.

134
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,510
After you succeed as the Eagle Queen.

135
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,660
you can come and go as you please.

136
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,180
You don't need to waste time
with me here.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,150
These thousands of years
are ultimately wasted.

138
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,560
Hong Yi,

139
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,270
you truly don't have me in your heart.

140
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,870
(That's fine.)

141
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,630
(I'll consider this as the answer
he gave me.)

142
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,390
Yan Shuang! Sorry, I'm late.

143
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,060
See what I brought for you.

144
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,110
Yan Shuang!

145
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,560

Your Majesty.

147
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,920
Where is Yan Shuang?

148
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,660
She probably went to the city.

149
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,500

I am painting the scenery
in the Mortal Realm,

179
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,430
happened to see Her Highness standing in
the rain, and just gave her a helpful hand.

180
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,270
A helpful hand?

181
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,350
What did you draw?

182
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,540
I can tell at a glance that
you have ulterior motives.

183
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,390
I met Her Highness at
the birthday banquet on Bainiao Island.

184
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,870
She was elegant and generous.

185
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,590
I was impressed and eager to
make friends with her.

186
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,780
(Letter of Challenge)

187
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,020
I do have affection for her,

188
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,110
but I dare not have
any improper thoughts.

189
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,110
You've been thinking about her
since you met her at Bainiao Island.

190
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,710
How dare you say you have
no improper thoughts?

191
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,550
Stop it.

192
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,390
You come here to cause trouble, do you?

193
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,440
No.

194
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,110
Didn't you say
you have something important to discuss?

195
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,510
There is nothing important.

196
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,510
Yan Shuang, I didn't mean to come late.

197
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,270
I was delayed by some important matters
with Feng Yin.

198
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,470
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,350
Let's go to the Pear Blossom Cottage.
I'll tell you.

200
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,590
I know.

201
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,660
It doesn't matter what caused the delay.

202
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,560
It's getting late. I'm going back first.

203
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,990
It's still raining. Let me send you back.

204
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,180
I want to paint some wind-moving stones
in the Eagle Clan.

205
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,750
Save it.

206
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,390
I am familiar with Yan Shuang.
I will send her back.

207
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,540
Stay away from these
unfamiliar immortals in the future.

208
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,020
They have no good intentions.

209
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,630
Why should I do as you say?

210
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,320
Do you know what I like, what I dislike,
what I want,

211
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,870
and how many friends do I have?

212
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,590
Lord Lian Xi and I feel like old friends
at first sight. We are good friends now.

213
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,180
It's just that you don't know.

214
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,300
You know nothing about me.
How could you make comments on me?

215
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,870
Yan Shuang, what's wrong with you?

216
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,420
Why do you behave
like a different person?

217
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,390
The relationship between immortals
and demons has never been good.

218
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,870
As the princess of the Eagle Clan
in the Immortal Realm,

219
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,780
I shouldn't always
go to your Demon Realm,

220
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,580
to avoid being talked about by others.

221
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,390
I've heard enough rumors and gossip.

222
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,390
For the sake of your reputation
as the Demon King and the Eagle Clan,

223
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,820
I won't go to find you anymore
from now on.

224
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,940
I didn't think you mind the difference
between immortals and demons.

225
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,710
Fine.

226
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,540
Since you think so, just do as you wish.

227
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,110
From now on, let's go separate ways.

228
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,870
Take care.

229
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,230
Let's go.

230
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,280
Father.

231
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,950
How could you forcefully drive your
internal core to enhance immortal power?

232
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,230
If something goes wrong,
your power will collapse.

233
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,470
If your internal core is injured,
your immortal root will be severed.

234
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,020
It is too dangerous to do this.

235
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,270
I thought I could become a demigod with
the help of the Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

236
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,590
I didn't expect to fail.

237
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,630
It's not easy to become a demigod.

238
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,350
If you want to enhance your
immortal power quickly, I'm afraid

239
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:50,390
you'll have to find another
internal core in the Immortal Realm.

240
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,870
Is there any other powerful internal core
of the deceased immortal?

241
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,150
There is no deceased,

242
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,350
but there are many alive.

243
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,590
Anyway, the aptitude of those immortals
is not as good as yours.

244
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,830
They can never become a god.

245
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,260
Instead of letting them
live a mediocre life,

246
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,660
it's better for you to use it.

247
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,260
In this way, they won't live in vain.

248
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,310
You ask me to take the internal core
of other immortals?

249
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,350
Father, you are asking me to
cultivate devil power?

250
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,830
It's just a way of cultivation.

251
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,630
Absolutely no.

252
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,220
It violates the rule for Acting Heavenly
Empress to cultivate devil power.

253
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,500
If Yuan Qi and Feng Yin know about this,
how could they forgive me?

254
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,630
How could I deserve the trust of Lan Feng
if I do this?

255
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,730
As long as you hold on to your integrity
and resist the temptation of devils,

256
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,900
you are still the Heavenly Empress
who never changes.

257
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,550
Others only see your growing power.
Who knows this secret?

258
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,710
Once I take this shortcut,
I will know the benefit of doing this,

259
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,910
How could I easily
hold on to my integrity?

260
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,750
Shu.

261
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,660
Father,

262
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,350
did you...

263
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,740
Yes, I did use this method.

264
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,420
Now, my immortal spirit
has fully recovered.

265
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,150
My power has also improved a lot
compared to before.

266
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,550
Although I practice devil power,

267
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,660
as long as I hide it well, no one will know.

268
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,830
You didn't discover this, right?

269
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,180
Father, what did you expect me to do
when you decided to do this?

270
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,860
If I punish you, I will be unfilial.

271
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,260
If I don't punish you, it would be unfair.

272
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,220
Shu, all that I did is for you.

273
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,000
If I didn't recover my immortal spirit
as soon as possible,

274
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,300
how could I help you maintain the throne
by handling internal and external matters?

275
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,070
No matter what, there is always
a proper solution.

276
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,940
Why did you choose to
cultivate devil power?

277
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,660
I knew my destiny and
had no ambitions in this life,

278
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,350
but you are different.

279
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,160
You are my outstanding pride.

280
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,790
You are the last hope of our clan.

281
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,000
But unfortunately, you have such a useless
father who lost all his immortal spirit.

282
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,350
Whenever I thought of these, I felt fearful.

283
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,350
In order not to burden you,
I had tried various methods,

284
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,390
but they didn't work, so I...

285
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,550
Shu, think about it again.

286
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,350
Do you know why Lan Feng's body didn't
decay in the coffin for a thousand years?

287
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,350
That's all because I've been
nourishing it with devil power.

288
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,310
I practiced devil power to
help you revive Lan Feng, too.

289
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,150
Can devil power revive Lan Feng?

290
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,190
Yes.

291
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,630
Devils can sacrifice everything
and of course revive everything.

292
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,220
I would not deceive you.

293
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,110
Shu,

294
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:09,390
everything I do is for you.

295
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,900
Qing Yi, you're back from your training.

296
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,500
Yes, I am.

297
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,740
But what about Martial Aunt?
She hasn't come back yet.

298
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,980
I think you have long forgotten about her.

299
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,500
I heard all about it
on my way here just now.

300
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,090
You are always lingering here,
trying to please Phoenix Queen.

301
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,800
I feel so sorry for Martial Aunt.

302
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,150
Qing Yi, you have grown up.

303
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,590
Now, you are more sensible.

304
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,500
I can't believe I called you Martial Uncle.

305
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,500
You are beyond help.

306
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,110
I should let her know that Qing Yi is back.

307
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,500
Martial Aunt,
you have been gone for a thousand years.

308
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,590
Martial Uncle has changed his mind.

309
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,940
I only hate myself for not being able to
defeat him and take revenge for you.

310
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,700
Martial Aunt, I've been working hard

311
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,180
every day to enhance my immortal power

312
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,900
as you told me.

313
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,550
Don't worry, I'll guard the gate
at all times

314
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,420
and keep the devils away from
Master and everyone else.

315
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,390
This is my tribute to my

316
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,910
Martial…

317
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,870
What?

318
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,870
You were mourning me a minute ago.

319
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,260
Now you can't recognize me?

320
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,350
You are Martial Aunt Yin.

321
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,340
As I traveled the Mortal Realm,
I had been looking for you.

322
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,980
But I had no luck.

323
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,030
I even asked every girl who loves
Pear Blossom Brew and mung bean cakes

324
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,350
whether they are you.

325
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,900
All right, you've passed the age to cry.

326
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,390
Let me taste the Pear Blossom Brew.

327
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,040
Let me taste it.

328
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,110
(Qing Yi and the Water Divine Beast Yin
have a friendship as fellow disciples.)

329
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,670
(If he says anything he shouldn't in front of
Feng Yin and causes a misunderstanding,)

330
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,500
(the marriage between His Godship and
Feng Yin will encounter problems again.)

331
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,980
(I have to let Feng Yin know that
Yin means nothing to His Godship.)

332
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,790
I don't know how much Qing Yi
has told you,

333
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,460
but His Godship is kind and never has
any thoughts of killing without reason.

334
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,220
The Water Divine Beast was his
fellow disciple and died under his sword.

335
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,260
His Godship was only soft-hearted
and found it difficult to accept this reality.

336
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,700
So he always showed concern about this.

337
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,980
In that case,

338
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,220
His Godship didn't protect
the Water Divine Beast as rumored.

339
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,260
There are always
all sorts of rumors outside.

340
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,180
Who else in the entire Three Realms
knows His Godship better than me?

341
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,630
After all, Yin had an ambiguous
relationship with devils,

342
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,030
and caused the deaths of the entire sect
of Daze Mountain.

343
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,180
His Godship insists on finding her

344
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,980
because he wants to find out
the truth of that year.

345
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,390
His waiting for a thousand years is
only for the case?

346
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,830
Of course.

347
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,220
After all, His Godship is a
determined True God.

348
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,180
His Godship never kept Yin in mind
no matter how tricky she was.

349
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,750
It was His Godship himself
who cut her affection back then.

350
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:35,260
I'm sure His Godship has no love for her,
only hatred.

351
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,630
You ask me to leave. Why?

352
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,590
Qing Yi has finally returned.

353
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,200
We disciples of Daze Mountain
have just gathered together.

354
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,870
I am also a member of Daze Mountain.

355
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,660
Please let me stay.

356
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,220
I don't have the patience to play
another whim trick with Your Godship.

357
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,790
What is a whim trick?

358
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,500
Let me tell Your Godship again.

359
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,910
I am Feng Yin, not Yin.

360
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,550
Stop using Yin's past to entangle me.

361
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,520
Let's get to know each other again

362
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,940
with the identity
of Yuan Qi and Feng Yin, okay?

363
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,700
Feng Yun, see the guest off.

364
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,110
Your Godship.

365
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,740
Your Godship, farewell.

366
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,040
Elder.

367
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,520
Your Godship.

368
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,150
What on earth has happened?

369
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,870
Why is the Phoenix Clan so impolite?

370
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,390
Aunt, why are you here?

371
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,110
I came to see Feng Yin

372
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,630
for the sake of your marriage.

373
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,350
What... what did you say to her?

374
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,590
There are always rumors about you
in the Three Realms.

375
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,510
In case she misunderstands
your past with Yin,

376
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,630
I've come to clarify.

377
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,390
I told her you have nothing but pity
for that Water Divine Beast.

378
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,910
Aunt, what did I tell you before?

379
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,790
Don't get involved in my love affairs.

380
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,180
Why don't you listen?

381
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,080
Your Godship.

382
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,750
I just want to do something good
for Your Godship.

383
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,030
I think you are too
idle in the Qingchi Palace.

384
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,260
Recently, demonic mandrills
are rampant in the East Sea.

385
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,660
I think you'd better go to the East Sea

386
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,550
to quell the chaos caused by them.

387
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,940
With these important matters,
you won't have so much idle time.

388
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,590
I…

389
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,080
Your…

390
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,190
This…

391
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,190
I…

392
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,560
What?

393
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,070
Be a spy?

394
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,740
What a shame for a prestigious weapon!

395
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,390
What's wrong? What happened?

396
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,660
After His Godship knew that
Feng Yin is Yin,

397
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,590
he was just overwhelmed by it.

398
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,960
To win her favor,

399
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,760
he asks me to pry into information
from Fuchen Sword.

400
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,150
We are both weapons.

401
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,310
Why should I do such a cheap thing?

402
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,590
Your Godship,

403
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,030
this method is

404
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,910
good.

405
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,150
Now, there are some clues on
how to save Your Godship.

406
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,870
Shouldn't we try to combine
two good things together?

407
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,350
I've heard Yin talking about it before
in the Hall of Arms.

408
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,260
If she couldn't do something,
she would turn to Fuchen Sword.

409
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,830
I was so envious at that time.

410
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,180
Having such a weapon
can save the master a lot of trouble.

411
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,830
Well, I don't like to force others.

412
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,660
After all, many things rely on talent.

413
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,030
Well, who said I can't do it?

414
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,590
You guys are looking down up on me.

415
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,040
I'll do it.

416
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,390
I will show you that
I am not only good at fighting,

417
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,180
I'm also the best when doing other things.

418
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,150
Your Godship,
it is already the seventh day.

419
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,830
Go into seclusion now.

420
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,510
You are my outstanding pride.

421
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,070
You are the last hope of our clan.

422
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:20,790
But unfortunately, you have such a useless
father who lost all his immortal spirit.

423
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,260
Whenever I thought of these, I felt fearful.

424
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,460
Devils can sacrifice everything
and of course revive everything.

425
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,220
(Lan Feng, I don't mean to
bend the rules for my father,)

426
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:41,550
(but no one in this world
loves me as much as you and him.)

427
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,550
In the past thousand years,
you have made a lot of sacrifices for me,

428
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,700
but I couldn't share your worries.

429
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:16,310
I hope you can stop in time and
don't make the same mistake again.

430
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,820
The race for the heavenly throne
is imminent and all forces are watching it.

431
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,660
Please take good care of yourself, Father.

432
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,150
Be cautious when dealing with others.

433
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,900
Make sure no one notices any clues.

434
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,940
I knew my daughter would protect me.

435
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,550
Don't worry, when I become
the ruler of the Immortal Realm,

436
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,160
I'll let you sit on the
Heavenly Empress's throne.

437
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,000
Report.

438
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:54,590
Your Lordship, Daze Mountain's disciple
Qing Yi returned to Qingchi Palace

439
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,500
and took a position in the Heavenly Palace
instead of returning to the Mortal Realm.

440
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,940
He stayed in the Heavenly Palace?

441
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,780
Yes.

442
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,350
Do you know what they are planning?

443
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,710
Qing Yi serves in the Hall of Arms.

444
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,390
Those immortal weapons
are very troublesome.

445
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,900
I had no opportunity to enter
and gather information.

446
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,480
Forget it.

447
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,260
Qing Yi is not to be feared.

448
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,940
Keep a close eye on Qingchi Palace.
Report any abnormalities to me.

449
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,260
The Pear Blossom Brew today
doesn't taste well at all.

450
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,180
Will she never come to see me again?

451
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,420
Forget it. She was the one
who got angry first.

452
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,870
I'm not looking for her.

453
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,000
You are here.

454
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,480
You look pretty today.

455
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,220
Jiu, do you want to go to
the Heavenly River with me?

456
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,870
It's not that I want to contact you.

457
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,870
Feng Yin asked me to tell you something.

458
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,550
So I have to talk to you.

459
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:13,150
Remember to reply to me. I'm waiting for
you at the Pear Blossom Cottage.

460
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,310
When all the immortals gather
at Yuan Qi's birthday banquet,

461
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,990
Feng Yin intends to reinvestigate the case
that happened a thousand years ago.

462
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,110
She needs you to tell the truth
you witnessed back then.

463
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,550
If I successfully clear my name,
it will be a great merit for you.

464
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,110
You can choose any treasure
from our Demon Realm.

465
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,860
Read?

466
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,430
No.

467
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,740
Can't she see the words
"I'm at the Pear Blossom Cottage"?

468
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,910
Alright, Yan Shuang. Let's wait and see.

469
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,350
We are done!

470
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,820
(Clouds Form over Mountains)

471
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,660
Your Highness, the birthday banquet
has been prepared properly.

472
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,180
All immortals and chiefs
have arrived one after another.

473
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,180
Has God Yuan Qi arrived?

474
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,470
No, he hasn't.

475
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:33,240
Your Highness, does it matter if
His Godship doesn't attend today?

476
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,260
There is no reason for me to withdraw
the invitations I sent out.

477
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,910
If Yuan Qi doesn't come,
find an excuse to cover it up.

478
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,950
What's important is to maintain a
superficial relation with Qingchi Palace.

479
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,380
Even if Yuan Qi doesn't show up,
I've prepared such a big banquet for him,

480
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,700
the immortals will not
discover the truth inside.

481
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,700
Feng Yin wants to reinvestigate
the case that year.

482
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,010
I finally learned from Fu Chen that

483
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,700
they plan to find an opportunity
in the Heavenly Palace.

484
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,150
Opportunity?

485
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,550
You inform Qing Yi to go to the Heavenly
Palace to attend my birthday banquet.

486
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,340
But Master, aren't you uninterested
in the banquet?

487
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,550
I've changed my mind.

488
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,700
Will you reveal the truth a thousand years
ago at the birthday banquet?

489
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,780
The Immortal Realm has concluded
that the destruction of Daze Mountain

490
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,300
and the death of Lan Feng

491
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,660
were caused by collusion between
the demons and the devils.

492
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,780
Although Yuan Qi has found some clues,

493
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,430
and seriously declared Yin's
innocence back then,

494
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,260
the immortals didn't comment on it.

495
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,340
However, they believed in their heart
that His Godship was biased.

496
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,260
Yuan Qi, as a God,
was even treated like this.

497
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,220
You will meet many more difficulties
than you think.

498
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,630
Have you made up your mind?

499
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,700
Yes. I've decided.

500
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,660
I know more details about the past.

501
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,990
It's time to go through the issues among
the immortals, demons and devils

502
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,110
carefully and thoroughly.

503
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,350
You're right.

504
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,990
Aunt.

505
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,550
Have a seat.

506
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,030
Why are you here?

507
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,220
I heard that you want to reinvestigate
the case at the birthday banquet.

508
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,990
I'm here to lend you a helping hand.

509
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,950
I don't need help from others.

510
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,870
But didn't you specifically
ask Hong Yi for help?

511
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,510
Why can't I?

512
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,150
How do you know that
I asked Hong Yi for help?

513
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:49,790
Since Yuan Qi is here,
let him finish speaking before refusing.

514
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,920
This is Cloud Pearl of Original Chaos.

515
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,340
I made it by refining the fragments of
the Truth Mirror with Chaos Power.

516
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,950
It can lead to the past and
uncover the truth.

517
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,990
Since you have this Cloud Pearl,
why didn't you bring it out earlier?

518
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,300
This is a demigod tool
that I just finished refining.

519
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,430
The tool spirit is still unstable
at the moment.

520
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,950
It may hurt the user if not used properly.

521
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,220
That's why I dare not use it easily.

522
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,950
I'm afraid you will get hurt.

523
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,220
Since you have decided to reinvestigate
the case at the birthday banquet,

524
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,340
it'll be the best time to use it.

525
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,840
Feng Yin,

526
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,950
you can tell me whatever you want to do.

527
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,110
I will definitely stand by your side.

528
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,820
Thank you, Your Godship.

529
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,780
Then, please lend me the Cloud Pearl
at that time.

530
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,860
However, other matters
will remain unchanged.

531
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,350
Farewell.

532
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,220
My disciple is clear about the distinction
between public and private matters.

533
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,300
Sometimes, I don't know whether I should

534
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,150
praise her or not.

535
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,780
You are also an inflexible child.

536
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,430
You two are equally stubborn.

537
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,760
Really?

538
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,030
Why are you still grinning here?
Go chase after her!

539
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,120
Farewell.

540
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,510
This is beautiful.

541
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,720
Yes.

542
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,780
The fragrance smells good.

543
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,700
- It looks so good!
- Look at that.

544
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,430
- Smell this.
- This.

545
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,270
This white flower

546
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,910
smells so good. It's beautiful.

547
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,590
The flowers are so beautiful this year.

548
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,720
That's great.

549
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,150
Your Majesty, Phoenix Queen of Wutong
Island arrives at the Heavenly Palace.

550
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,340
Shall we go and greet her?

551
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,280
I know.

552
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,430
Let the fairy attendants
take good care of her.

553
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,660
I am busy with the preparations
for the birthday banquet.

554
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,550
I have many guests here.
I can't get away.

555
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,820
Ask her to forgive me
if she thinks I neglect her.

556
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,840
Yes.

557
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,780
Your Majesty, the golden peonies
in your Xiuyang Hall

558
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,300
are truly a stunning beauty.

559
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,150
In the Heavenly Palace,

560
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,660
even the whole Immortal Realm, it's
impossible to see such beautiful flowers.

561
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,590
I think these peonies in the garden
are stunning,

562
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,590
but no one can compare to
the beauty of Her Majesty.

563
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,820
That's right.

564
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:21,470
The person to the heavenly throne will be
selected and appointed soon.

565
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:26,590
Her Majesty Feng Yuan will hand over
the Seal of the Supreme to Hua Shu.

566
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,220
No matter how beautiful
the blooming flowers are,

567
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,780
they cannot compare to the beauty
of the Heavenly Empress.

568
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,550
This has not been finalized yet. Please
refrain from making such remarks.

569
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,950
Several immortals and the chiefs of
the Three Mountains and Six Palaces

570
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,550
have gone to the South Heaven Gate
to welcome her.

571
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,620
These respected immortals have not
shown up for many years.

572
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,300
They appear as soon as
the Phoenix Queen comes.

573
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,400
Let's go quickly.

574
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,760
Shall we go or not?

575
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,600
I don't know.

576
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,300
I am a junior.

577
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,260
I am ashamed to have you seniors here
to welcome me.

578
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,530
Your Majesty, you can settle disputes
between the two realms at a young age.

579
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,740
We appreciate it so much.

580
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,280
Moreover, Your Majesty inherits
the throne of the Phoenix Queen.

581
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,470
We should come to congratulate you.

582
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,780
Your Majesty didn't want to bother others,

583
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,850
and omitted all the
troublesome formalities.

584
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,950
We shouldn't save the congratulations
when meeting you today.

585
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,110
Thank you for your appreciation.

586
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,350
Please.

587
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,600
Please.

588
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,990
Feng Yin.

589
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,430
I looked around just now.

590
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:35,510
Many immortals are coming here
to welcome you.

591
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,590
They chattered like hundreds of ducks.

592
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,630
It's so noisy.

593
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,260
Will you get out of here now?

594
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,340
They want to meet me so much?

595
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,700
Let's go and meet them then.

596
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,510
Who is this?

597
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,680
Do you know?

598
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,030
No.

599
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,510
Who is this?

600
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:43,780
It seems she is more powerful than
Her Majesty Hua Shu.

601
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,000
Yu from Qingchi Palace.

602
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,150
Feng Huan from Wutong Island.

603
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,830
Greetings to Your Majesty Hua Shu
and all the immortals.

604
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,390
- It's the Phoenix Queen.
- It's the Phoenix Queen.

605
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:02,380
She is the Phoenix Queen.

606
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,620
It's the Phoenix Queen.

607
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,950
- Phoenix Queen.
- Phoenix Queen.

608
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,630
